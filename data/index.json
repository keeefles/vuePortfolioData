    "about": [
        "Born 3 Febraury 2005, in the lovely city of Cape Town - I've grown to love coding because of my dad's passion for technology when I was younger. Hey there! I'm Aakeefah Jones, a 19-year-old full-stack developer who's all about making cool websites. I got into the tech world because I love making things look awesome and work smoothly for people. If you couldn't tell by my portfolio - I really love Frontend Developing.",
        "I'm kinda obsessed with the design side of things, making sure it's not just lines of code but actually looks really good. I've got big dreams of turning my coding skills into a business. I want to create websites that go beyond the usual and give people experiences they didn't even know they wanted.",
        "If you're into cool tech stuff or have ideas to share, hit me up! (I speak two English and Afrikaans too if you're looking for a candidate whose multilingual *wink wink ;)* ). I'm open to teaming up or getting involved in exciting projects. Check out the rest of my Portfolio!"
